## Project Overview
**Space Invaders Game** is a Python-powered recreation of the nostalgic Space Invaders arcade game, combining engaging gameplay with modern coding standards. It includes well-organized assets, efficient sprite handling, and scalable code architecture, making it suitable for further customization and development.

This project was developed to demonstrate Python proficiency in game development, software architecture, and GitHub documentation practices.

## Features
- **Modular Code Design**: Organized into separate classes and functions to ensure easy maintainability and scalability.
- **Dynamic Alien Waves**: Aliens spawn with random movements and increasing difficulty levels.
- **Smooth Animations and Sound Effects**: Integrated with animations and sound to enhance gameplay experience.
- **Realistic Health & Collision System**: Health indicators for player and hit detection with explosion animations.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Efficient use of sprite groups and clock management for smooth gameplay on multiple devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language used for all game logic and structure.
- **Pygame**: A Python library that provides modules for game development, handling graphics, and audio processing.
- **GitHub**: For version control, collaborative development, and project documentation.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.x and Pygame are installed:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Clone Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd SpaceInvaders
```

### Run the Game
Start the game using:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Game Structure
The game code is organized into key classes and functions:

- **Spaceship Class**: Manages player actions, including movement, shooting, health, and collision detection.
- **Aliens Class**: Represents alien enemies with attributes for movement and attack patterns.
- **Bullets Class**: Controls both spaceship and alien bullets, including collision logic.
- **Explosion Class**: Handles explosion animations triggered by collisions.
- **Draw Functions**: Utility functions for rendering text, backgrounds, and health indicators on the screen.

## Gameplay
### Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move spaceship left
- **Right Arrow**: Move spaceship right
- **Spacebar**: Shoot bullets

### Objective
Survive waves of alien attacks by dodging incoming bullets and destroying aliens. The game ends with either a **victory** (all aliens defeated) or **game over** (spaceship health reaches zero).

### Game States
- **Game Start**: A countdown timer before the aliens begin attacking.
- **Game Over**: Shown when spaceship health depletes.
- **Victory**: Triggered upon clearing all alien waves.

## Assets
### Images
Assets are stored in the `img` folder, including:
- **Spaceship** (`spaceship.png`): Player-controlled ship.
- **Aliens** (`alien[1-5].png`): Various alien types.
- **Bullets** (`bullet.png`, `alien_bullet.png`): Player and alien bullets.
- **Explosions** (`exp[1-5].png`): Explosion frames for collision effects.
- **Background** (`bg.png`): Game background.

### Sounds
Sound effects enhance gameplay and are stored in `img`:
- **Explosion** (`explosion.wav`, `explosion2.wav`): Explosion sounds.
- **Laser** (`laser.wav`): Laser shooting effect.

## Future Enhancements
This project is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for potential enhancements, including:
- **Levels and Progressive Difficulty**: Introducing multiple levels with varying difficulty settings.
- **Power-Ups**: Adding collectible items for health boosts, rapid fire, or shield.
- **Scoreboard and High Scores**: Saving and displaying top scores.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Adding local or online multiplayer support.
